  Virtual element method (VEM) is firstly proposed by L. Beir√£o da Veiga [1] which has the following feature
  <ul>
  <li> VEM can be applied to arbitrary polygonal mesh </li>
  <li> VEM is able to handle hanging nodes on element edge> </li>
  </ul>  
These two features have made VEM a power tool and have
