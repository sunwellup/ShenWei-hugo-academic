title: Investigation of virtual element method
summary: Virtual element method (VEM) is considered as as general finite element method because it can used for any arbitrary polygon meshes. The main idea of VEM is to project the function in virtual element space (i.e., the space of shape functions) to a polynomial space with predefined order.
