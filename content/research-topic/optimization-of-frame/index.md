title: Shape and topology optimization of plane frame
summary: Ground structure method is widely used for truss-like or skeleton structure, and in some cases the optimization problem can be further reduced to linear programming problem or convex optimization such as second order cone optimization. On the other hand, simultaneous shape and topology optimization can start from a rather sparse initial structure where not all the possible connections among the nodes are needed.
