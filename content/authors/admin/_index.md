● I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Architecture and Architectural Engineering at Kyoto University, supervised by <a href="http://www.se-lab.archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ohsaki/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:#2D7BD1;text-decoration:underline;">Prof.Ohsaki Makoto</a> <br/>
● My research interests lie in the areas of structural optimization and computational mechanics, including structural optimization under uncertainty (such as reliability-based structural optimization and robust optimization), as well as the combination of computational mechanics with structural optimization <br/>
● I received my Master's degree in Chongqing University supervised by <a href="http://civil.cqu.edu.cn/info/1322/6160.htm" target="_blank" style="color:#2D7BD1;text-decoration:underline;">Prof.Wenliang Fan</a> <br/>
